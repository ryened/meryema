+         <p>I am not coming here to say I regret what I did, because I didn’t. I only regret us not building the things that we said we were going to build. I am here to say that I give you a chance to fix it like I always do. To be honest, I don’t care who you are calling behind my back; I know what I am doing. I just want you to realize that they don’t want you the way I do. I really wanted to build something with you, and you know that. I didn’t give up on us; I just want to see if you really do love me. Would you really die for me? You said yes in text calls, but in the end, you didn’t even call me. I was waiting on you for 9 days, 1 hour, and 11 minutes, and yes, I count even the minutes because my love can’t be hidden. During this period, I only thought about my future and waited on you. I was waiting for a call from your mom’s number or Mimi because I felt like I was one of them. Actually, I was thinking, are you going to do it? But sadly, as I can see, you really can breathe and keep going without me. For 5 months, I didn’t ask about your past or even try to control you. At first, I only wanted your love, and then I was testing it from time to time, and you know that I have trust issues. But I don’t know if you believe it or not, I really trusted you until you messed it all up. Anyway, Meryem, I made an update for this website on April 27, 2025, at 6:30 because I know if you are ever going to open this site, it is because you miss me. I am here to say I didn’t want this to happen in the first place. I will update this every 10 days until your absence kills my love for you. Meryem, you really messed me up, and I know you worry a lot about your self-esteem. That’s why I want this to work. If you really love me and you really want us for us, just do something for us.</p>
